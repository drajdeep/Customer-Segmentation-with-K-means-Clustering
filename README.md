1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd customer-segmentation`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib`

## Usage
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`customer_segmentation.ipynb`) to execute the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Explore the clusters and visualize the results.

## Results
- View the clustered customers in the 2D plot generated by the algorithm.
- Obtain insights from the identified customer segments for targeted marketing and personalized services.
